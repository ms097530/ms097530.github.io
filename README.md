# About
This is a portfolio website for yours truly. It was built using ReactJS.

Figma was used to design the desired appearance of the website and its components. The link to my design can be found above, in the Project Links section. The design was inspired by portfolio websites for [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/) and [Ian Dunkerley](https://dunks1980.com/). I took inspiration from the neon coloring and minimalist design aspects present in both projects.

My portfolio website is developed using a mobile-first approach in order to take advantage of much of the default styling that is applied by the browser. This enabled my styling design to use minimal media queries while still getting an appropriately flexible layout.

The project is comprised of a single page with no routing. The Intersection Observer API was utilized through the `react-intersection-observer` package. This package allowed for implementation of animations when a component or parts of a component first come into view.

The navigation bar utilizes the `react-bootstrap` package's `Navbar` component to take advantage of all the desired functionality and facilitate styling.

As for the icons and images, I used SVG icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com) so that I could style the icons themselves. For my headshot image, I used Adobe's [background remover tool](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/remove-background) so that I could style the image with a drop shadow to create a sort of 3D effect.

For the API, I decided to use a free dad joke API because I enjoy bad jokes and wanted to reward whoever made it to the end of my portfolio with something I enjoy and hope that they do too.
